# Task 1
## TITANIC_SURVIVAL_PREDICTION

Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a
passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginner
project with readily available data.
The dataset typically used for this project contains information
about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket
class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived

To perform Titanic survival prediction using the steps you provided, here's a general outline of how you can proceed:

### 1. Data Acquisition:
Obtain the Titanic dataset, which typically includes features like age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and survival status.
### 2. Handle Null Values:
Analyze the dataset for missing values in each column.
Impute or remove missing values based on the nature of the data and the missingness pattern.
### 3. Handling Outliers:
Identify potential outliers in numerical features such as age and fare.
Decide whether to remove outliers or apply transformations based on the distribution of the data.
### 4. Count of Gender:
Calculate the count of passengers by gender to understand the gender distribution in the dataset.
### 5. Count of Survived:
Calculate the count of passengers who survived and those who did not survive.
### 6. Gender-Based Survival:
Analyze the survival rate based on gender to understand if there's a correlation between gender and survival.
### 7. Random Forest Model Implementation:
Prepare the dataset by encoding categorical variables and splitting it into training and testing sets.
Implement a Random Forest classifier using a machine learning library such as scikit-learn.
Train the model using the training dataset.
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Tune hyperparameters if necessary to improve model performance.
Test the model on the testing dataset to assess its generalization ability.

### 8. Comparison 
Comparing these metrics with the actual data can help validate the model's effectiveness and identify areas for improvement. 
It's crucial to assess the model's performance across different evaluation metrics to gain a comprehensive understanding of its strengths and weaknesses.







# Task 2

#MOVIE RATING PREDICTION WITH PYTHON
##Data Acquisition:
Obtain a dataset containing information about movies, including features like genre, director, actors, release year, runtime, and rating.

##Data Preprocessing:

##Handle missing values: 
Analyze the dataset for missing values in each column and decide whether to impute or remove them based on the nature of the data.
Encode categorical variables: Convert categorical variables like genre, director, and actors into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Split the dataset: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets to train the model and evaluate its performance.

##Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Explore the distribution of movie ratings using visualizations like histograms, box plots, and violin plots.
Analyze the relationship between movie features (e.g., genre, director, actors) and ratings to understand their impact on the ratings.

##Feature Engineering:

Extract additional features from existing ones if necessary. For example, you can create new features like the number of actors, the total number of movies directed by a director, or the average rating of a director's previous movies.
Perform feature scaling if required to ensure that all features have the same scale.


##Model Selection and Training:

Choose an appropriate regression model for predicting movie ratings. Common models include linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting.
Train the selected model using the training data. Adjust model hyperparameters to optimize performance if necessary.


##Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the trained model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared.
Use cross-validation techniques to assess the model's generalization ability and mitigate overfitting.

##Prediction and Interpretation:

Make predictions on the testing dataset using the trained model.
Interpret the model coefficients or feature importance scores to understand which features have the most significant impact on movie ratings.
Model Improvement:

Fine-tune the model by experimenting with different algorithms, feature combinations, or preprocessing techniques to improve prediction accuracy.
Consider ensemble methods or advanced regression techniques for better performance if necessary.
