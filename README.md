# Task 1
## TITANIC_SURVIVAL_PREDICTION

Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a
passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginner
project with readily available data.
The dataset typically used for this project contains information
about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket
class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived

To perform Titanic survival prediction using the steps you provided, here's a general outline of how you can proceed:

### 1. Data Acquisition:
Obtain the Titanic dataset, which typically includes features like age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and survival status.
### 2. Handle Null Values:
Analyze the dataset for missing values in each column.
Impute or remove missing values based on the nature of the data and the missingness pattern.
### 3. Handling Outliers:
Identify potential outliers in numerical features such as age and fare.
Decide whether to remove outliers or apply transformations based on the distribution of the data.
### 4. Count of Gender:
Calculate the count of passengers by gender to understand the gender distribution in the dataset.
### 5. Count of Survived:
Calculate the count of passengers who survived and those who did not survive.
### 6. Gender-Based Survival:
Analyze the survival rate based on gender to understand if there's a correlation between gender and survival.
### 7. Random Forest Model Implementation:
Prepare the dataset by encoding categorical variables and splitting it into training and testing sets.
Implement a Random Forest classifier using a machine learning library such as scikit-learn.
Train the model using the training dataset.
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Tune hyperparameters if necessary to improve model performance.
Test the model on the testing dataset to assess its generalization ability.

### 8. Comparison 
Comparing these metrics with the actual data can help validate the model's effectiveness and identify areas for improvement. 
It's crucial to assess the model's performance across different evaluation metrics to gain a comprehensive understanding of its strengths and weaknesses.
